                        <p>Under this theme research efforts are aimed at advancements in specific transport system modal categories (Road, Rail, Aerospace and Maritime). The work stream employs a “cradle to grave approach” when evaluating and developing new technologies/innovations for decarbonisation of the sector. Projects include but are not limited to autonomous vehicles (AVs), green aircraft taxiing, electric powertrain enhancements and power electronics development.</p>

                        <p>The effectiveness of transport decarbonisation heavily relies on its fuel supply. Hence, this stream will focus heavily on the supply of energy in the form of electricity from generation to delivery. This will require work in advancing charging infrastructures (wireless and wired); railway electrification, integration of low carbon generation to the grid, optimisation of geographical energy distributions and an increase in network asset utilisation; resilience and efficiency.</p>

                        <p>Bi-directional energy and information will be commonplace in a decarbonised future. Consequently, data analytics, energy exchange-based systems e.g. V2G – and cyber security are at the forefront of this network theme. A focus will also be placed on exploiting efficiency savings through flexible storage and demand side response. Furthermore, Big Data and the Internet of Things (IOT) is set to produce a new marketplace with specific revenue growth in the mobility sector. It is critical to be at the forefront of the development of these services.</p>
